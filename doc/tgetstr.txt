Synopsis:

Description:

String Value of a Terminal Capability

The string value of a terminal capability refers to a sequence of characters or escape codes used by a terminal to perform a specific action. These actions can include clearing the screen, moving the cursor, enabling bold text, etc.

For example, in the terminfo database:

    "cl" is the capability for clearing the screen.
    "cm" is the capability for moving the cursor to a specified position.

The tgetstr function retrieves such sequences for the terminal you are working with.
Example:

char *clear_screen = tgetstr("cl", NULL);
tputs(clear_screen, 1, putchar); // Clears the screen.

Example:

char *clear = tgetstr("cl", NULL);
printf("Clear sequence: %s\n", clear);
